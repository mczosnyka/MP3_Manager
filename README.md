# Music Album Manager
This project is a simple application made using WPF, .NET and SQLite. \
I created this app for my grandfather, to help him manage album collections on his computer. \
This app is essentionally a GUI for an SQLite database, which consists basic data about user's albums. \
To start the application open launch.lnk file or MP3Manager\MP3Manager\bin\Debug\net7.0-windows\MP3Manager.exe file \
In order to use "Dodaj ze Å›cieÅ¼ki" option, every album's name you provide should follow this order:
** AristName - AlbumName (year) ** \
spaces and other special characters are allowed in artist's and album's name. Year must be between 1000 and 2999. \
Application is only available in Polish ðŸ‡µðŸ‡±
